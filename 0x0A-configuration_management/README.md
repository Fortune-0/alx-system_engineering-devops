Puppet is a tool used for managing and automating the configuration of servers. It allows users to define the desired state of the systems in their infrastructure through Puppet's Domain-Specific Language (DSL) known as Puppet Code. This code is declarative, meaning users describe the desired state of their systems rather than the specific steps needed to achieve that state.

Puppet operates using a client-server model. The Puppet primary server stores the code that defines the desired state of the systems. The Puppet agent, installed on the target systems, interprets the Puppet Code and executes the necessary commands to bring the systems into the desired state. This process is known as a Puppet run.

Overall, Puppet simplifies server management by automating the process of configuration management, ensuring consistency across different devices and operating systems in an infrastructure.
