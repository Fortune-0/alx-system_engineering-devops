				ABOUT THE PROJECT "Loops, conditions and parsing"

Loops: Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. There are three types of loops in Bash scripting:
For loop
While loop
until loop

Conditions: Conditions are used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. They are typically used in combination with loops and control structures.

Parsing: Parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures. In Bash scripting, you can parse strings, files, and command outputs.
